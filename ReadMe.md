# Message Forwarder Bot

Idk why this exists in the first place, anyways..
This bot sends the message to the target group from a group. (yes, that's it).

## Setting up 
* First:
> `APP_ID` and `API_HASH` - Get it from my.telegram.org   
> `BOT_TOKEN` - Get it from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)   
* Chose a platform to deploy on:

[![Deploy To Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/samurai-maker/MessageForwardbot)

# Usage
Add me to both the groups first...   
Use "/frwd <to group id/username> <message/reply to message>" to forward the message to that group.
